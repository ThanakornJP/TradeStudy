# Master Class Bootcamp {#bootcamp} 
`Game of Probability`
`The more Confluences, the more favour`
`Strategy = Structure(Constant), Pattern(Probability), Behaviour(Dynamic)`
`3-simple-thing to be examined`

### 1. Market Structure
1. Identify direction
    1. Downtrend = LH and LL
    2. Uptrend = HH and HL
    3. Ranging


`Tip` : Identify 4H direction, then trade the same direction as 4H 

`Tip` : Focus on `TODAY`. Don't look back to far, we only need fresh trend not the major trend bcoz we are day trader; we get in and out the same day.

`Note` : Trade with the trend 
- trade when you can find direction bias clearly
- no trade for ranging market

`Note` : No matter what timeframe apply the same concept
- structure is structure
- H4 is holy grail for day trader 

2. Identify 2 levels
    1. Uptrend = Latest higher high and higher low
    `Note` : we expect new High from price breaking above lastest higher high
    `Note` : we monitor price breaking below latest higher low because it is possibly sentiment change in the market. It doesn't mean market turnaround, it means erratic so get out of the market today

    2. Downtrend = Latest lower low and lower high

### 2. Chart Patterns {chart-pattern}
`identify setup` 

    1. DownTrend
        1. Simple break and retest
            - spot previous low broken
            - anticipate pullback at previous **lower low** broken 
            ![downtrend-retest](downtrend-retest.png)
        2. Deep pullback
            - it retests *deeper* to previous **lower high** instead of **lower low**
            - `Note`: trend is only gonna reversed if it breaks previous lower low and lower high; otherwise, downtrend is still predominant. Thus, don't quickly jump into buy bias unless you see those levels has broken.
            ![downtrend-deep-pullback](downtrend-deep-pullback.png)
        3. Cheeseman
            - Similar to deep pullback, but it didn't create **lower low**. This shows more sign of reversal but hold on. Remember! reversal isn't gonna happen if previous **lower high** and **lower low** still hold 
            ![downtrend-cheeseman1](downtrend-cheeseman1.png)
            ![downtrend-cheeseman2](downtrend-cheeseman2.png)
        4. Reversal
            - Key is to succint sign of uptrend reversal which is 
                - fail to create higher high
                - violate previous higher low 
                - form lower low and high
                - breake recent lower low and retest it
            - `Note`: wait until trend is settle by showing break and retest
            ![downtrend-reversal1](downtrend-reversal1.png)
            ![downtrend-reversal2](downtrend-reversal2.png)
            ![downtrend-reversal3](downtrend-reversal3.png)
    2. UpTrend
        1. Simple retest
            - classic break and retest in uptrend
            ![uptrend-retest1](uptrend-retest1.png)
            ![uptrend-retest2](uptrend-retest2.png)
        2. Deep pullback
            - Don't discount your buy bias just because simple retest isn't found
            ![uptrend-deep-pullback1](uptrend-deep-pullback1.png)
            ![uptrend-deep-pullback2](uptrend-deep-pullback2.png)
            ![uptrend-deep-pullback3](uptrend-deep-pullback3.png)
        3. Cheeseman
            - Again, fail to create **higher high** and respect previous **higher low**
            - `Note`: all you have to do is to watch closely if it's gonna break below **previous higher low** to revert the trend or respect for continuation
            - `Note`: momentum is really key to make a decision if you're riding on the continuation
            ![uptrend-cheeseman1](uptrend-cheeseman1.png)
            ![uptrend-cheeseman2](uptrend-cheeseman2.png)
            ![uptrend-cheeseman3](uptrend-cheeseman3.png)
            ![uptrend-cheeseman4](uptrend-cheeseman4.png)
        4. Reversal
            - `Note`: we're not looking for reversal but we stalker the trend with confluential evidence 
            ![uptrend-reversal1](uptrend-reversal1.png)
            ![uptrend-reversal2](uptrend-reversal2.png)
            ![uptrend-reversal3](uptrend-reversal3.png)
            ![uptrend-reversal4](uptrend-reversal4.png)
            ![uptrend-reversal5](uptrend-reversal5.png)
3. Candlestick - identify the trigger
    1. Behaviour
    2. 3-candle Formation
        ![candle-formation](candle-formation.png)

        1. Momentum candle
            - `Tip`: main entry signal
        2. Depletion candle
            - no one in control
        3. Rejection candle / Wick rejection
            - `Tip`: more often than not it's sign of reversal 
            - bullish rejection: bear controls first then bull comes later
            - bearish rejection: bull comes first then losing power to bear    
    3. Momentum candle - Strength, Momentum, Volume and Control
        1. Strength 
            - ![candle-strength](candle-strength.png)
        2. Usage
            - `Tip`: Always wait for pullback since any continuation requires exhaustion
            - `!!!`: Structure + Key Level + Momentum = your only indicator
            - ![structure-momentum-ex1](structure-momentum-ex1.png)
            - ![structure-momentum-ex2](structure-momentum-ex2.png)
    4. Depletion candle - Weakness, indecision 
        1. No direction, no decision 
            - ![candle-depletion](candle-depletion.png)
        2. Usage
            - ![structure-depletion-ex1](structure-depletion-ex1.png)
        3. `Tip`: more often than not price will continue in the direction that broke the range. So always mark range bound (high and low) to frame the price and anticipate the dominating control after range broken
        ![structure-depletion-range](structure-depletion-range.png)
        4. `Tip`: never more often than not price will continue in the direction that broke the range 
        5. `Note`: link all behaviour along especially what will be shown around key levels

    5. Rejection candle- Weakness, failure, continuation/reversal
        1. price is really stimulus and it's about to reverse or resume
            - bullish rejection (wick @ bottom): while downtrend, bull tries very hard to push back the bear
            - bearish rejection (wick @ top): in uptrend, bear scorns the bull
            - ![candle-rejection](candle-rejection.png)
        2. Usage
            - ![structure-rejection-ex1](structure-rejection-ex1.png)
                - 1st bearish rejection in an uptrend means nothing since no level is formed yet. Only trending higher high and higher are shown. 
                - next bearish rejection means something (no decision yet). if momentum seems depleting, then reversal might be awaiting.
                    - `Tip`: we dont trade reversal so do jumb right in. 
            - ![structure-rejection-ex2](structure-rejection-ex2.png)
                - it's confluencing of wick rejection on bearish body
                - `Tip`: be careful! In this bullish reversal, you need **new level** to be developed to prove that bull is really in control now by breaking the 1st higher high and retest it for continuing in reversed trend. Otherwise, it is just a cheeseman (still bearish) 
            - ![structure-rejection-ex3](structure-rejection-ex3.png)
                - 1st evidence, we see bullish rejection in the downtrend 
                - 2nd evidence, we don't see lower low in the downtrend, but **higher low** instead
                - 3rd evidence, we see bullish rejection at **higher low**
                - 4th evidence, we see price breaks the **recent high** with momentum candle
                - 5th evidence, we see price retests the **recent high**
                - 5 confluences confirm reversal 

### Key Level
1. simple retest level
    - ![key-level-retest](key-level-retest.png)
        - simple break and retest - recent level is somehow the most important as we are day trader
2. cheeseman
    - ![key-level-cheeseman](key-level-cheeseman.png)
    - normal cheeseman: double top shown in deep pullback with fail to break to create lower low
    - upside down cheeseman: double bottom shown in deep pullback with fail to break to create higher high  
3. example
    - ![key-level-ex1](key-level-ex1.png)
        - ![key-level-ex1-2](key-level-ex1-2.png)
    - ![key-level-ex2](key-level-ex2.png)
        - ![key-level-ex2-2](key-level-ex2-2.png)
        - bull tryna push up but fail by leaving its wick at top
    - ![key-level-ex3](key-level-ex3.png)
        - ![key-level-ex3-2](key-level-ex3-2.png)
            - `Tip`: when we see depletion candles, we **must wait** to see who will be in control, and may look back in chart to the left to spot the important level. Because, market is indecisive at this level so there must be some **evidence in the past**. 
            - ![key-level-ex3-3](key-level-ex3-3.png)
            - `Tip`: wait only until momentum candle comes to show us who is in control (bull or bear)
            - ![key-level-ex3-4](key-level-ex3-4.png)
            - After market reveals direction, then we need to wait further structure (higher/lower high/low)to be developed
            - ![key-level-ex3-5](key-level-ex3-5.png)

### Your thought process count! 
Don't rush
Don't skip
Don't try to make money
Follow rules and processes
First, focus on high probable trade not the smart entry. Then, sharpen your entries and exits

### Execution with Multiple Timeframe Confluence 
`4H-1H-15M/30M`

1. Ex. trade with the major trend (4H)
    1. `4H` @ Structure must be in line with direction you plan to trade
    - ![multitimeframe-ex1-1](multitimeframe-ex1-1.png)
    2. `4H` @ Price must break key level and close below 
    3. `4H` @ Price should come back to retest but not break above --> `exhaustion`
    - ![multitimeframe-ex1-2_3](multitimeframe-ex1-2_3.png) 
    4. `15M` @ redraw micro (intraday) structure 
    - ![multitimeframe-ex1-4-1](multitimeframe-ex1-4-1.png) 
        - `Tip`: we repeat steps again in micro timeframe
    - ![multitimeframe-ex1-4-2](multitimeframe-ex1-4-2.png) 
    5. `15M` @ find evidence to spot the resuming of major trend --> `push`
        1. depletion ex. wicks
        2. pattern ex. double top
        - ![multitimeframe-ex1-5](multitimeframe-ex1-5.png) 
    6. `15M` @ entry
    - ![multitimeframe-ex1-6](multitimeframe-ex1-6.png) 
2. Ex. another simple break and retest
    - ![multitimeframe-ex2-1](multitimeframe-ex2-1.png) 
    - ![multitimeframe-ex2-2](multitimeframe-ex2-2.png) 
    - ![multitimeframe-ex2-3](multitimeframe-ex2-3.png) 
3. Ex. awkward situation (price go nowhere) and `BOBBI Pattern`
    - ![multitimeframe-ex3-1](multitimeframe-ex3-1.png) 
    - ![multitimeframe-ex3-2](multitimeframe-ex3-2.png) 
        - `Note`: if last lower high was broken in the downtrend, then price is highly possible to revert in uptrend 
        - `Tip`: even it is bullish sign, but it also could be `BOBBI patter` so wait 1 more **4H candle** to see if it's gonna break back in or rally bullishly
    - ![multitimeframe-ex3-3](multitimeframe-ex3-3.png) 
    - ![multitimeframe-ex3-4](multitimeframe-ex3-4.png) 
4. Ex. something we don't really expect but it's real
    - ![multitimeframe-ex4-1](multitimeframe-ex4-1.png) 
        - instead of break, it's leaving huge wick. Thus, **wait** patiently 
    - ![multitimeframe-ex4-1](multitimeframe-ex4-2.png) 
    - ![multitimeframe-ex4-1](multitimeframe-ex4-3.png) 

### Wrap-up
1. Basic rule
    1. 4H - direction bias
    2. 1H - identify wick rejection (optional)
    3. 15M - entries
    - always wait for candle close
    - **stick to rules and processes**
    - buy in bull, sell with bear
2. Entries
    - every trade/setup must meet your criteria
    - every trade/setup must be journalized  
    - always apply multiple `confluences`
    - buy in buy bias, sell when sell bias
    - candle formation (`behaviour`) is the key for entries
3. Target
    1. 1:2 - 1:3 
    - stay with the today (`present`); don't be possessed by data on the left (history); Never to the left
    - `High and low` are the key to consider so make sure we have enough range for price to hit 1:2-1:3
    - don't forget to seal profit by 50% closing `BE1:1` 
    - `don't rush and greedy`; slow & steady
4. Stop Loss
    1. place above/below key level or structure high/low
    2. risk 1% always
    3. take no more 2 trades a day
    - don't worry about the `SL size` as long as it serves 1:2-1:3 even bigger SL size normally causes smaller TP. Focus on priciple and take as large SL as it's supposed to
5. Time
    1. London (LDN) Open for 2hr --> `2-4pm` GMT+7 
    2. New York (NYC) Open for 2hr --> `7-9pm` GMT+7
    3. Look chart every 4hr --> `2am, 6am, 10am, 2pm, 6pm` GMT+7
    - don't look at your chart after London Close --> `11pm` GMT+7
6. Pairs
    1. `GBPUSD`, `EURUSD`, `USDCHF`, `EURJPY`
7. No Trade
    - don't recognize pattern
    - don't fit criteria
    - humming or harring (so unsure)
8. Important
    - digest information your own way --> `find the way to process`
    - stay consistent
    - stay `disciplined` --> daily basis regardless of the result
    - rinse and repeat --> `don't quit` and keep ongoing
    - practice will not make perfect --> `don't be perfect` trader but be better you
    - keep it stupid simple

6. Trading Plan 
`Clear Trend + Proven Momentum + Risk Management`

    1.  Clear and Current **Trend**  — H4
        - Trending/Cont. Pattern (Pattern + Direction = opportunity)
            - HH+HL / LL+LH with break-and-retest (previous level or trend line)
            - HH+HL / LL+LH with break and 50% pullback
            - HH+HL (uptrend) with break-and-fail-to-retest-but-form-Double Bottom (accumulation) —> no new structure just drop
            - LL+LH (downtrend) with break-and-fail-to-retest-but-form-Double Top (distribution) —> no new structure just drop
            - (Ranging) Break-out-Break-Back-in, retest, then continue 
                - Consolidation = no decision
            - Reversal sign: Never anticipate a reversal !
                - Break trend line + form new structure + retest with success pattern
                    - (Downtrend to uptrend): HH+HL —> double bottom
                    - (Uptrend to downtrend): LH+LH —> double top
                - Break trend line + form new structure + retest with failed pattern
                    - (Downtrend to uptrend): HH+HL —> HL
                    - (Uptrend to downtrend): LH+LH —> LH
        - Pattern
            1. Simple trending 
                1. Direction
                    1. Uptrend: buy at HL: if it doesn’t break h4 low, wait for retest and rejection before buy
                    2. Downtrend: sell at LH: if it doesn’t break h4 high, wait for retest and rejection before sell
                2. Formation
                    1. pullback and momentum push = HL/HH or LH/LL
                    2. Pullback and failed push (double top/bottom) = HL/lower High or LH/higher Low
            2. Break structure, wait for retest
            3. Break trendline, wait for retest 
            4. Double top/bottom, wait for momentum or broken structure  
            5. Missed Double top/bottom, wait for momentum or broken structure
            6. V-shape by engulf first, then wait for retest with coming pinbar or double top/bottom
            7. Consolidation: wait for break structure and retest 
            8. Double top/Trending market + Breakout, wait for  break back in + retest: Sell stop
            9. Break-out-Break-backin on H4 only
            10. Double top/bottom on H1/H4 only
        - Current
            - Right to left charting. 
            - When new structure is found, neglect the past and never expect trend resuming because it was reversed
                - Otherwise, anticipate cont. pattern for trend resuming 
        - Confirmation of failing to break
            - (Conservative) H4 close >= 1 candle at key level
            - (Intraday-like) H1 close >= 2 candles at key level
        - Analysis (Question)
            - What is direction bias?
            - Would I buy or sell?
            - Is this push or pullback phase?

    2.  Proven **Momentum** — H1/M30 + M15/M5
        - Scenario
            - Early(aggressive): 2 x wick rejections at major price level
                - Wick rejection = directional bias
            - Proven(conservative): Price must violate structure completely 
                - momentum shift (H1-higher timeframe) = break and retest (M15-lower timeframe)
        - Enter only on pullback
        - Wait for retest 
            - Never be the 1st to get in
            - Let it prove 

    3.  Valid **Risk** —  enough room
        - possible BE — 1R 
            - BE zone’s size = SL zone’s size
        - Possible TP — 3R
            - Range to next zone/level > 2R
            - No let profit run but close all at 3R
        - Hedging SL — 1R
            - SL = Protective zone = Capital shield 
                - Price must be in the middle of SL zone
                - SL mustn’t be in the area that pullback might take place
                - SL must cover significant level (prevent whipsaw and trap)
            - Valid SL can cause BE 
            - SL amount 
                - Agressive: 5pip 
                - Conservative: 10pip

7. Step 
    1. Pick pivoting level on W1 
    2. Notify movement on D1
    3. Analyse trend — H4
    4. Analyse price structure on H4
    5. Analyse behaviour when price approaching key levels — H1/M30
    6. Anticipate at — M15
        1. 1st rejection at key level to spot momentum 
        2. 2nd rejection at key level to manage position with rules and conditions

# Practice and Sample {#practice-and-sample}

--- 
# Tip and Note {#tip-and-note}
1. During push phase, if it exhausts to somewhere in between, it is still in the game. But, if it pullbacks to the origin of previous phase, reassess the structure again coz it is liquidity correction where structure may be probably changed.
2. For retesting point, we disregard long wick’s area but accounting for small wick area.
3. For clear structure both ranging and trending, we can draw a trend line or box to do buy or sell respecting touch points 
4. Don’t enter with engulfing bcoz SL is too big
5. Try to stay with the current moment as much as possible; don’t collect information from the past at the very beginning.
6. Strong candle <> news inflicted candle
7. The lower timeframe, the more pure of the behavioural analysis which is no pattern involved 
8. Cheese man = double top/bottom of lower high/higher low 
9. FOMO fixed by waiting for retest aligning with H4 bias
10. Direction(h4) + Evidence(h1) + confirmation(h1) + behavioural (h1,m30,m15) + enough range (m15) ALWAYS
11. Price must retest the strong level before driving further
12. 10-15pip SL only
13. Close Breakeven as quickly as possible if things turn against 
    1. Move SL to BE
14. Trade 10AM - 3PM
15. Fix h4 level-of-analysis on lower timeframe 
16. H4 H1 m15
17. H4 - look for direction
18. H1/M30 - look for sign of rejection ex. Wick rejection 
19. Wick rejection not engulfing
    1. In case of engulfing found, there is coming wick rejection in form of pinbar. 
20. 5% a day , 15% a month
21. Preserve capital FIRST, proceed with procedure and process LATER
22. Momentum is the wick rejection in M30
23. It doesn’t matter h1, m30 or o15 because we expect the rejection at level not specific formation. So, enter as long as you can find SL area.
24. Take into account news and time
25. No perfect retest, observe their intention (momentum shift)
    1. Trade breakout (momentum shift) at NY Open  not London Open
26. Possible event
    1. Come back to retest
    2. Break retest level
    3. Fail to retest 
27. Secret
    1. Price statistically come back to retest major zones to form double top/bottom for liquidity 
28. Wider SL, more room to breath, longer TP to be hit.
29. Stop dealing with entry and secure your capital by focus on breakeven trade along the process
30. Market behaviour = presenting behaviour not the pass so when structure changes, anticipation and stop loss must be revised accordingly. When behaviour changes. Connect the dot to see clearer picture (clear level). Finally, it depends on my capital investing. The more capital, the wider SL I can endure

# Daily Question & Ask {#daily-qa}
1. what is `Direction`? 
2. Shall we `Sell or Buy`?
3. Is this `Push or pullback`?
4. What `pattern` shall we apply?
5. What `behavior or evidence` shall we need in confluence?
6. Do we wait for `momentum or rejection`?
7. Do we have enough room for `BE and TP`?

> I wanna see clear trend on H4 with the formation HH/HL or LH/LL to see if buyer or seller is in control. With the being said, I will mark out the recent high/low with the complete break and retest anticipation, and laddering levels from price distribution or level 2 data. Then, 2 things to confirm directional bias are behaviour at price levels in H1   and significant rejections in M15

# Grocery of Key Ideas {#grocery}

### Trading Process {#trade-process}
1. Use `w1` for pivoting
2. Use `d1` to identify movement
3. Use `h4` to identify key level and structure high/low and direction
4. Use `h1` 
    - to monitor behaviour of price approaching the key level 
    - to monitor price approaching the key level 
5. Use `m30` and `m15` to monitor 1st sign of rejection
6. Enter with `momentum`, `valid SL, BE and RRR`
    1. Momentum
        1. Price must violate structure completely 
        2. Momentum shift in higher timeframe = break and retest in lower timeframe
    2. Valid SL 
        1. Must not be in the area that pullback might take place
        2. Must be hold/against the significant level 
        3. It must be able to make BE
    3. Valid BE
        1. Size of BE zone = Size of SL zone
        2. Once price violate BE, shift SL in to make a trade breakeven
    4. Valid RRR
        1. Range to next zone > 1:2RR
        2. 1:3 RR
        3. 5SL —> 15TP or 10SL —> 30TP
7. Document and retrospect 

### Trading Perceptive Intuition {#trade-perceptive-intuition}
1. Momentum shift in higher timeframe = Break and retest in lower timeframe
2. Changing level, trendline, HH, LL = `Trend`
3. Wick rejection = `Direction Bias`
4. Pattern = `Opportunity`
5. SL zone = Capital Shield or `Protective Zone`
    1. Price must not be greater than `50%` of the protective zone
    2. Use `Buy/Sell Stop` to wait for price to get back in the zone
6. Consolidation = `No Decision`
7. Best plan = Simple Stupid plan that is highly disciplined
8. News = Major `Market Correction`; it's not really manipulation but adjustment at the moment
9. Sunday & Monday = Marjor `Market Correction`; Sunday correction impact so be aware. 

### Indicator {#trade-indicator}
1. SMA200 - direction
2. `EMA50` - mean value. In forex, **price always approaches the mean value** which is more comfortable 
3. EMA14 - immediate movement


### Trading Pattern {#trade-pattern}
1. Simple trending 
    1. Direction
        1. Uptrend: buy at HL: if it doesn’t break h4 low, wait for retest and rejection before buy
        2. Downtrend: sell at LH: if it doesn’t break h4 high, wait for retest and rejection before sell
    2. Formation
        1. pullback and momentum push = HL/HH or LH/LL
        2. Pullback and failed push (double top/bottom) = HL/lower High or LH/higher Low
2. Break structure, wait for retest
3. Break trendline, wait for retest 
4. Double top/bottom, wait for momentum or broken structure  
5. Missed Double top/bottom, wait for momentum or broken structure
6. V-shape by engulf first, wait for coming pinbar afterwards
7. Consolidation: wait for break structure and retest 
8. Double top/Trending market + Breakout, wait for  break back in + retest: Sell stop
9. Break-out-Break-backin on H4 only
10. Double top/bottom on H1/H4 only

### Chart Pattern {#pattern-chart}
`Chart pattern forms strategy`

Some text with [a link][1] and
another [link](#bootcamp).

> see bootcamp/chart pattern for more detail
1. Simple break and retest - `continuation`: break retest 1st level
2. Deep pullback - `continuation`: break and retest 2nd level
3. Cheeseman - `continuation`: not break and retest 2nd level
4. Reversal - `reversal`: not break but break 2nd level reversely  

### Entry Pattern {#pattern-entry}
1. 4H Wick Rejection
2. Breakout 50% retracement
3. Over-extended continuation
4. Bottom/Double Top continuation
5. Fail to break above/below

### Rule {#trade-rule}
1. Trend
    - always analyse the `current only`
    - only `clear direction` to be analyzed
2. Entry
    - only Pattern must be discovered
    - enter only on a pullback
    - enter at key level
    - Only with Direction bias
    - Only with Momentum
    - Only valude 1:1`BE`
    - Only valid 1:2-1:3`RR` 
        - 1:2 if SL is wide 
    - `Wait - Behavior Signal`
        - Wait price come into `SL zone` before triggering a trade with `STOP Order`
        
        > For `Stop Order`, try to make the entry **at the centre** as much as possible. Manipulate it in the range we bet. Ex. We know anticipating SL and current price (close). Then, stop order entry = current price (close) - (SL-current price (close)). The same range to make it at the centre

        - Wait at least `1 x h4/h1 close` at key level before proceeding = not to be the 1st one
        - Wait at least `2 x h1 rejection` at key level to confirm failing to break = not to be the 1st one
        - Enter only with `2 wick rejections` regardless of other patterns
    - `Wait - Structure`
        - Downtrend = LH+LL 
        - Uptrend = HH+HL
        - Downtrend-Double Top (DDT) = cheeseman
            - DB = reversal but we don’t take reversal 
        - Uptrend-Double Bottom (DDB) = cheeseman
            - DT = reversal but we don’t take reversal
3. SL
    - Always above key level
4. Take Profit
    - Always enough room to take profit and momentum 
5. BE
    - always partially close 50% at major level 
    - let another 50% left for letting it all run and hit TP
6. Mindset
    - Keep it Simple always
    - Never anticipate for a reversal (Never be the 1st to get in; let market prove itself)
    - Never forecast but react with processes
7. No trade 
8. Time
    - Time range= 5-8p-10p
    - Focus on 30min before NY Open = 7.30p
9. NEWS and Events
    - NEWS, manage position if I am in; otherwise, decide wisely if news can benefit the entry


### Key Level {#trade-key-level}
`No such perfect line` 
We need Only `Structure` since it's dynamic and responsive to current market sentiment

1. Structure Highs 
2. Structure Lows
3. `Strong Level`
    - `V-shape`: it signifies big orders there. Then, wait for double top/bottom at that level
    - `Bull/Bear trap`
    - `BOBBI`
    - `SL Hunt`
4. Broken trendline
5. `1W` Pivot

### Reading Value {#read-value}
1. EURUSD = `4` floating points ex. 1.22096 - 1.22008 = 0.`0008`8 = 8.8 pips
2. USDJPY = `2` floating points ex. 104.614 - 104.462 = 0.`15`2 = 15.2 pips
3. Gold = `-2` floating points ex. 1284.12 - 1282.12 = 2`.`00 = 200 pips 

### Reading Chart {#read-chart}
1. Always look from right to left
2. When new structure was formed in H4, we disregard the past. Especially, when we anticipate the double top/bottom, it won’t be validated anymore. Thus, when new structure was formed, we won’t expect the trend resuming but new reversal trending. However, if we cannot spot the new structure, we can still anticipate the resuming of the current trend.
3. Find bias in H4, then anticipate pattern and behaviour from H1 and M15 respectively.

### Processing H4-H1-M15 {#h4-h1-m15}
1. Key takeaway
    1. It is more aggressive ( faster entrance )
    2. It closes BE more often
2. Pattern
    1. Pullback 50% then continue
    2. Breakout, break back-in, retest, then continue
3. Tips
    1. Confirm by 1 x H4 close 

### Processing H4-H1-M30 {#h4-h1-m30}
1. Key takeaway
2. Pattern
    1. Break trend line and form double top/bottom
    2. Break structure and retest
    3. Break structure, fail to retest, then form double top/bottom
    4. Fail to break structure, form double top/bottom
3. Tips
