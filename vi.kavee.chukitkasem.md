# Step 1 - Scan

> find good (SME, Mid Market) companies that yield > 12% PA for over 10 years

> financial statement is the compass

### Properties of 1000% company in next 10 years
1. grow consistently in long-term 
2. have bargain power
3. be leader in industry
4. invest in what they are specialised 
5. strong financial statement 
6. no need big investment in the future
7. no need large customer to make revenue
8. have good and governed executive 

### Financial statement's component
1. balance sheet
2. cashflow statement
3. income statement (profit and loss statement)

> the hardest part is to decipher financial ratio

### Financial ratio from income statement
1. Net profit per share 
>  consistently increased EPS reflects positively competitive advantage in long run rathen than fluctating between profit and loss

2. Gross profit margin 
> the longer GPM, the stronger competitive advantage 

3. Expense per Revenue
> The lower cost of goods sold (COGS), the stronger brand it is. Avoid those whose EPR is fluctutated

4. Interest expense
> the lower expense, the lower COGS, the higher potential to make profit 

5. Net profit margin
> consistenly increase NPM reflects good company

### Financial ratio from balance sheet
1. Debt
> the lower, the better, the longer stability
2. fluidity, current ratio - use for debenture analysis
> ratio isn't the indicator to evaluate company
3. Return on Equity 
> consistently increased ROE is better for long term
4. Return on Asset 
> the higher, the better, the more worth of investment
> Too high ROA brings new competitors who they might have more potential 
5. return on dividend
> consistently increased ROE is better for cash flow 


### Valuation 

> Price is what you pay. Value is what you get

> It is required to find stock fundamentally for value investment. 

> **Patience** is the key. Patient to wait until price comes back to reasonable/expecting level, until you know what you're going to buy, until you know reason to sell/hold

> We do it to awake intuition when you wait for buying starbuck 50% off. We know their scent and taste so it's worth waiting to buy when it's cheap/discounted 

1. Tool - simple yet practical (no non-presice inside required)
1.1 Dividend 
1.2 P/E
1.3 P/BV

2. Approach
2.1 Top-down

Analyze macro/micro economic to assess entry/exit point. Basically, we are looking for economics crisis to find cheap stocks ex. subprime, tomyumkung, etc. `Key` is not to know `how far it's about to occur`, but to know `if it is about to occur or it was occured`

Economics crisis or bubble's indicator is `GDP expansion` and `Inflation`

**GDP**
process all economics indicators including consumption, investment, expense,export, import, etc.

The more GDP growth, the more profit registered company derived. The more profit, the high stock price and likewise.

We need to analyze historical backward and future estimation

**Inflation**
an increase in level of prices of goods and services 

[/] good inflation = increase demand 
[x] fake inflation = increase of cost of goods sold ex. increase global oil or copper price, increase agriculture product bcoz of natural catastrophe, etc. `cost` gets increased, `profit` remains the same, `consumers` will then say `expensive`

`Deflation` reflects less purchase in the economics and causes recession.

[x] fake inflation - hard to fix, fear instituted
[xx] deflation - hardest to fix, lost confidentialiy 

**!! `GDP` usually conforms `Inflation`  !!**
The more GDP growth, the more salary, the more expense, the more demand, then the more expensive pricing causing good inflation. In the fresh growth of GDP, pricing won't get instantly affected due to the fact that production line processes stock. Up until, demand keeps surging and surpasses the processing stocks, good inflation is shown 

###### Top-down Approach 1: Economics Cycle
1. recovery and inflation decreased
2. expansion and inflation increased
3. slowdown and inflation increased
4. (pre-recession | recession | post-recession) and inflation decreased --> buy stock here 

###### Top-down Approach 2: Investment Clock
1. slowdown

`strategy`  
2. recesssion

`strategy`
3. recovery

`strategy`
4. boom

`strategy`

**!! If `Inflation` exceeds `GDP`, it's going to be `recessive`  !!**

`Economic crisis` usually occurs when `interest` goes high. It is before market shifts into phase #4 (`recession`), it would cause inflation go higher. Then, inflation will also drive interest automatically. 

**!! The more increased interest, the less consumption !!** 
The more interest, the more `cost of living`, the less `business loan`, the less `consumtion`

> The crisis will reveal only after good news like tsunami.

It is `important` to learn `from history` how much discount can we have based on `statistics ` 

It is `more important` to know whether the discount is caused by fundamental changes. If not, it is `cheap to invest`

Not only `big crisis`, but `small meaningful crisis`, `industrial crisis`, and `individual stock crisis` ex. flood affects tourism and insurance, politic affects retail and entertainment, pandemic affects heathcare and tourism, etc. We have to anticipate `fundamental strength` and `30% off` of the peak to buy the stock we are interested.

2.2 Bottom-up

# Step 2 - Buy only if it is cheap
????


# Step 3 - Deversify

`total risk = unsystemetic risk + systemetic risk`

> idea: we must invest > 30 stocks to mitigate unsystemetic risk
> recommed: we should invest 10 <= # of stocks <= 15

### Approaches
1. manage it yourself: DCA on 10 diversified stocks   
2. thru fund manager: DCA on 2-3 diversified funds 

# Step 4 - Track
> require skillful, patient, decisive 

> financial report: quarterly, mid-year, fiscal year

> Don't let lost trade be with us for so long. Cut it fast, Warren Buffet

### What to be analyzed
1. revenue - รายได้
2. gross profit margin - อัตรากำไรขั้นต้น
3. SG&A ratio - อัตราส่วนค่าใช้จากการบริหารต่อรายได้
4. interest expense - อัตราส่วนค่าใช้จ่ายดอกเบี้ยต่อกำไรก่อนดอกเบี้ยและภาษี

# Step 5 - Project long-term

> Don't waste your time on speculation but profiling your portfolio

> discipline = long-term investment 
> patience = wait for good opportunity to buy and sell. hold it patiently

# Step 6 - Continuously improve 

`watchlist keeps your portfolio healthy`

> always manage watchlist and portfolio

# Note 

### VI Philosophy - **patient** for right *stock* and *timing*
1. look for good fundamental company 
    1. quantity approach - กำไรสุทธิต่อหุ้นเติบโตสม่ำเสมอ(EPS),อำนาจต่อรองกับลูกค้าสูง(GPM), high share market or market leader,ฐานะทางการเงินแข็งแกร่ง,ความสามารถในการทำกำไรสูง(ROE),ผู้บริหารเป็นมืออาชีพและมีธรรมาภิบาล
    2. quality approach (5 forces model)
        - 3 forces for selection - ดูแลต้นทุนได้ดีแค่ไหน,สามารถขึ้นราคาสินค้า/บริการได้,เป็นผู้นำในธุรกิจ
        - 2 forces for decision - คู่แข่งที่จะเข้ามา,ระวังสินค้าทดแทน
    Note: what not to invest
        1. company that must greatly invest for making revenue
        2. tech. company (if you ain't keen in technology)
        3. auction company
        4. commodity company (highly fluctuating)
        5. company that depends on particular executive
        6. company that you don't know - mission, vision, executive, products, competitor, etc. 
2. buy only when it is cheap 
3. hold until it changes fundamentally or found sth better
4. mitigate risks by diversifying portfolio and holding long period
5. be accountable and discipline for what you do
6. log, research and improve always

### What to be analyzed every quarter
1. eps
2. gpm
3. sg&a to sales
4. interest expense to EBIT
5. intetest bearing debt to equityroe
6. good governance of executive
7. how keen you are for that particular stock
