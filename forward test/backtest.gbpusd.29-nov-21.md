strategy: breakout 30% retracement
`lesson learned` I lost focus on `15M`; price doesn't have to respect 50% perfectly.

strategy: breakout 50% retracement
`software error`
1. sw stop me out, but it's actually 
- 50% 1R/BE 
- 50% 3R/TP

[x] `19-Jan-21` `8:00`
strategy: break-n-retest
`lesson learned` I don't take trade bcoz no room for 3RR (too wide SL)

[x] `20-Jan-21` `16:30`
strategy: wick rejection 50% retracement
`reason` I don't take trade bcoz it doesn't reject the level

[-] `26-Jan-21` `5:00`
strategy: double top in the uptrend 
`reason` got anxiery during taking trade bcoz it's not nice double bottom. It's between deep pullback and retest level. More importantly, market has not decided direction yet

[x] `26-Jan-21` `8:30`
strategy: breakout 50% retracement
`reason` SL is too wide, and it is eventually like BOBBI in H4
