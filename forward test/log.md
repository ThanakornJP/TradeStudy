# Forward Testing

---

**11-OCT-21** I can't see much of clear direction so wait until 9p before leaving charts.
- GBPUSD, looks like uptrend but hesitate to break above to create new level 
- USDJPY, uptrend but no clear level to refer
- USDCHF, look like cheeseman, but it's quite inerted so wait for cheeseman + break & retest
- EURUSD, looks like break & retest but lack of momentum downward
- XAUUSD, ranging for 2 weeks
