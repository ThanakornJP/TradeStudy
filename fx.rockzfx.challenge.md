# Rockz 5D Challenges

(I) Pattern + Criteria
(II) Momentum 
(III) SL/RRR



[ RockzFz Rule ]
1. Clear trend first
2. Enter only on a pullback
3. Enter at key level
4. Enter only with 2 wick rejections regardless of other patterns
5. Analyse/Wait for only 
    1. Downtrend = LHLL 
    2. Uptrend = HHHL
    3. Downtrend-DT ( DB = reversal but we don’t take reversal = cheese )
    4. Uptrend-DB ( DT = reversal but we don’t take reversal = cheese)
6. Never anticipate a reversal (Never be the 1st to get in; let market prove itself)
7. Manage risk strictly
    1. 1:1BE
    2. 1:3RR
    3. 50% partial of 1:2RR

[ Daily Question ]
Direction 
Sell or buy
Push or pullback

I wanna see clear trend on H4 with the formation HH/HL or LH/LL to see if buyer or seller is in control. With the being said, I will mark out the recent high/low with the complete break and retest anticipation, and laddering levels from price distribution or level 2 data. Then, 2 things to confirm directional bias are behaviour at price levels in H1   and significant rejections in M15 




12% margin
18% margin
Normally 20-22% margin


[ Step ]
1. Use w1 for pivoting
2. Use d1 to identify movement
3. Use h4 to identify key level and structure high/low and direction
4. Use h1 to monitor behaviour of price approaching the key level 
5. Use m30 and m15 to monitor 1st sign of rejection
6. Enter with momentum, valid SL, BE and RRR
    1. Momentum
        1. Price must violate structure completely 
        2. Momentum shift in higher timeframe = break and retest in lower timeframe
    2. Valid SL 
        1. Must not be in the area that pullback might take place
        2. Must be hold/against the significant level 
        3. It must be able to make BE
    3. Valid BE
        1. Size of BE zone = Size of SL zone
        2. Once price violate BE, shift SL in to make a trade breakeven
    4. Valid RRR
        1. Range to next zone > 1:2RR
        2. 1:3 RR
        3. 5SL —> 15TP or 10SL —> 30TP
7. Document and retrospect 


[ H4-H1-M30 ] 
1. Key takeaway
2. Pattern
    1. Break trend line and form double top/bottom
    2. Break structure and retest
    3. Break structure, fail to retest, then form double top/bottom
    4. Fail to break structure, form double top/bottom
    5. 
3. Tips


[ H4-H1-M15 ] 
1. Key takeaway
    1. It is more aggressive ( faster entrance )
    2. It closes BE more often
2. Pattern
    1. Pullback 50% then continue
    2. Breakout, break back-in, retest, then continue
3. Tips
    1. Confirm by 1 x H4 close 

[ Reminder ]
1. Momentum shift in higher tf = break and retest in lower tf
2. Wick rejection = directional bias 
3. Pattern = opportunity 
4. Keep it Simple 
5. SL zone = protective zone so called capital shield 
    1. Price must not be greater than 50% of the zone
    2. Use Buy/Sell Stop to wait for price to get back in the zone
6. News  —> majorly market correction
7. Sunday & Monday —> majorly market correction, Sunday correction impact so be aware. 

[ Rule ]
1. Always analyse the current only
2. Always enough room to take profit and momentum 
3. Only Pattern must be discovered
4. Only Direction bias can be set 
5. Only with Momentum
6. Only valid SL 
7. Only valid BE
    1. Close 50% if BE at major level 
    2. Or, let it all run and hit TP
8. Only valid RRR
9. Keep it Simple always
10. Wait price come into SL zone before triggering a trade with STOP Order
11. Wait at least 1 x h4/h1 close at key level before proceeding = not to be the 1st one
12. Wait at least 2 x h1 rejection at key level to confirm failing to break = not to be the 1st one
13. Time range= 5-8p-10p
14. Focus on 30min before NY Open = 7.30p
15. NEWS, manage position if I am in; otherwise, decide wisely if news can benefit the entry

[ Charting ]
1. Always look from right to left
2. When new structure was formed in H4, we disregard the past. Especially, when we anticipate the double top/bottom, it won’t be validated anymore. Thus, when new structure was formed, we won’t expect the trend resuming but new reversal trending. However, if we cannot spot the new structure, we can still anticipate the resuming of the current trend.
3. Find bias in H4, then anticipate pattern and behaviour from H1 and M15 respectively.



[ SL ]
1. For Stop Order, try to make the entry at the centre as much as possible. Manipulate it in the range we bet. Ex. We know anticipating SL and current price (close). Then, stop order entry = current price (close) - (SL-current price (close)). The same range to make it at the centre 

[ Pattern ]
1. Simple trending 
    1. Direction
        1. Uptrend: buy at HL: if it doesn’t break h4 low, wait for retest and rejection before buy
        2. Downtrend: sell at LH: if it doesn’t break h4 high, wait for retest and rejection before sell
    2. Formation
        1. pullback and momentum push = HL/HH or LH/LL
        2. Pullback and failed push (double top/bottom) = HL/lower High or LH/higher Low
2. Break structure, wait for retest
3. Break trendline, wait for retest 
4. Double top/bottom, wait for momentum or broken structure  
5. Missed Double top/bottom, wait for momentum or broken structure
6. V-shape by engulf first, wait for coming pinbar afterwards
7. Consolidation: wait for break structure and retest 
8. Double top/Trending market + Breakout, wait for  break back in + retest: Sell stop
9. Break-out-Break-backin on H4 only
10. Double top/bottom on H1/H4 only

[ Tip ]
1. During push phase, if it exhausts to somewhere in between, it is still in the game. But, if it pullbacks to the origin of previous phase, reassess the structure again coz it is liquidity correction where structure may be probably changed.
2. For retesting point, we disregard long wick’s area but accounting for small wick area.
3. For clear structure both ranging and trending, we can draw a trend line or box to do buy or sell respecting touch points 
4. Don’t enter with engulfing bcoz SL is too big
5. Try to stay with the current moment as much as possible; don’t collect information from the past at the very beginning.
6. Strong candle <> news inflicted candle
7. The lower timeframe, the more pure of the behavioural analysis which is no pattern involved 
8. Cheese man = double top/bottom of lower high/higher low 
9. FOMO fixed by waiting for retest aligning with H4 bias
10. Direction(h4) + Evidence(h1) + confirmation(h1) + behavioural (h1,m30,m15) + enough range (m15) ALWAYS

[ Reading ]
1. EURUSD = 4 floating points ex. 1.22096 - 1.22008 = 0.0008|8 = 8.8 pips
2. USDJPY = 2 floating points ex. 104.614 - 104.462 = 0.15|2 = 15.2 pips
3. Gold = 1st digit ex. 1284.12 - 1282.12 = 2.00 = 200 pips 

[ Indicator ]
1. SMA200 - direction
2. EMA50 - immediate movement

Strong level is
- Spot v-shape as big orders there. Then, wait for double top/bottom at that level



Consolidation = no decision 

Tips
- Price must retest the strong level before driving further
- 10-15pip SL only
- Close Breakeven as quickly as possible if things turn against 
    - Move SL to BE
- Trade 10AM - 3PM
- Fix h4 level-of-analysis on lower timeframe 
- H4 H1 m15
- H4 - look for direction
- H1/M30 - look for sign of rejection ex. Wick rejection 
- Wick rejection not engulfing 
    - In case of engulfing found, there is coming wick rejection in form of pinbar. 
- 5% a day , 15% a month
- Preserve capital FIRST, proceed with procedure and process LATER
- Momentum is the wick rejection in M30
- It doesn’t matter h1, m30 or o15 because we expect the rejection at level not specific formation. So, enter as long as you can find SL area.
- Take into account news and time
- No perfect retest, observe their intention (momentum shift)
    - Trade breakout (momentum shift) at NY Open  not London Open
- Possible event
    - Come back to retest
    - Break retest level
    - Fail to retest 
- Secret
    - Price statistically come back to retest major zones to form double top/bottom for liquidity  
- Wider SL, more room to breath, longer TP to be hit. 
- Stop dealing with entry and secure your capital by focus on breakeven trade along the process
- Market behaviour = presenting behaviour not the pass so when structure changes, anticipation and stop loss must be revised accordingly. When behaviour changes. Connect the dot to see clearer picture (clear level). Finally, it depends on my capital investing. The more capital, the wider SL I can endure 


Technique
1. Momentum shift in higher timeframe = Break and retest in lower timeframe
2. Changing level, trendline, HH, LL = trend
3. Wick rejection = direction bias
4. Pattern = opportunity
5. SL zone = shield, protective zone 



Step
1. Use d1 to identify movement
2. Use h4 to identify key level and structure h/l
3. Use h1 to monitor price approaching the key level 
4. Use m30 and m15 to monitor 1st sign of rejection
5. Enter with valid SL and RRR
